# learn-python-the-hard-way
My journey through 'Learn Python the Hard Way'. From a physics student to data scientist.

This repository documents my journey through Zed A. Shaw's "Learn Python the Hard Way" and Youtube tutorials as I merge being a physics student with becoming a data scientist, combining analytical thinking with practical coding skills. 

🎯My goal 
- is to build a strong programming foundation to pursue a career in machine learning and data science and to buy my first car through my coding skills.

🎓Background
- I am a physics student from South Africa. While my formal education provides strong analytical and mathematical foundations, I am complementing my degree with **self-directed programming education** through structured learning, project-based learning and consistent practice. I want to demonstrate initiative, growth, and real technical ability through this repository.

🛠️Tools
- Language: Python 3
- Editor: VS Code
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
- Learning Resources: LPTHW + Bro Code (YouTube)

Progress⏳🚀:
Week 1 (Python🐍)
- Basic command lines                       (✅ Complete)
- Basic Syntax                              (✅ Complete)
- Variables, Type casting, User input, Math (✅ Complete)
- If statements(if, elif, else)             (🔄 In Progress)

I am building this public repository to track my growth, stay accountable, and create a learning timeline that shows consistency, discipline, and improvement.
